<div class="c-border-content-title-4">Sample Code in This Post</div><br>
If you want to see how the code is written directly, you can: <a href="#tutorial">Go to Code Analysis</a><br>
In this project, Kotlin, Google's MLKit, and the native AndroidX camera are used to implement the QR scanner.<br>
<div style="text-align: center">

<div class="c-border-content-title-4">Implementation Effect</div><br>
<img src="/images/mlkit/002.gif" width="30%"><br><br>

<div class="c-border-content-title-4">Introduction</div>
In the past, we used some third-party libraries to create QR code scanners<br>
such as zxing, zbar, etc.<br>
Recently, in a project, QA feedback indicated that the current QR code scanner's accuracy was not very high.<br>
So I looked into it and tested it, and finally understood why the `accuracy was not very high`.<br><br>

In fact, it was because:<br>
The project used the old `android.hardware.Camera` with `zbar` to parse QR codes<br>
and scanned from a side angle or from a distance.<br>

This made the QR code scanner feel slower compared to iOS.<br>

So I decided to try implementing it using Google's `MLKit`.

<div class="c-border-content-title-4">What's Different About MLKit?</div>
  - This API requires `Android API 21` or above.
  - The API provides two versions<br>
  One can dynamically download the module from gms<br>
  One uses the module that comes with the library, as shown:
    <img src="/images/mlkit/001.png" width="80%"><br><br>
  - I referred to examples and used the new native camera library `androidx.camera` with `ML Kit`.<br>
	Compared to the original project using `zbar` with `android.hardware.Camera`:<br>
	↪ Both camera libraries are supported from Android API 21 and above.<br>
	↪ The version using `zbar` with `android.hardware.Camera` had three workarounds.<br>
	I suspect the original project or previous examples used this approach to solve camera initialization issues in the activity.<br>
	So they wrote it like this:<br>
    <img src="/images/mlkit/002.png" width="80%"><br><br>
    <img src="/images/mlkit/003.png" width="80%"><br><br>
    <img src="/images/mlkit/004.png" width="80%"><br><br>
    ↪ After looking into it, `android.hardware.Camera` is not thread-safe and has been @Deprecated.
	<img src="/images/mlkit/005.png" width="50%"><br><br>
	<img src="/images/mlkit/006.png" width="80%"><br><br>
	↪ On the other hand, the new `androidx.camera.core.Camera` comes with lifecycle management to handle camera lifecycle issues.<br>
	This can avoid some strange lifecycle problems.<br>
  ✅ So I speculate that switching to the new `androidx.camera.core.Camera` can more effectively avoid lifecycle issues (because you can control it yourself).<br><br>
  - The new androidx.camera.core.Camera comes with lifecycle management to handle camera lifecycle issues, avoiding some strange lifecycle problems.
  	<img src="/images/mlkit/007.png" width="80%"><br><br>
  - The scanner decoding uses MLKit's BarcodeScannerOptions.<br>
  It enhances the types of barcodes that can be parsed.<br>
  You can refer to <a href="https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/barcode-scanning/android?hl=zh-tw#1.-configure-the-barcode-scanner">this link</a> for the supported formats. Below is the scanner decoding code:
	<img src="/images/mlkit/008.png" width="80%"><br><br>

<div class="c-border-content-title-4">Implementing MLKit and Actual Testing</div>
  - Tested on `LG K520 Android 11`

  - The overall runtime of the camera on `LG K520 Android 11` did not differ much<br>
  In practice, from `init camera` to `parsing QR code` takes about 1 second <br>
  However, it can avoid the `camera crash risk caused by lifecycle`
  - The actual test shows a slightly faster response speed compared to the original solution (not noticeable on better phones, minimal difference)<br>
  For example, `zbar` + `android.hardware.Camera` will completely `focus` before starting to decode the QR code<br>
  `mlkit` + `androidx.camera.core.Camera` can start decoding the QR code `halfway through focusing`<br>

  - The image on the left uses `zbar`, and the right uses `ML kit` (this gif is slowed down to `0.25x`)
  - `androidx.camera.core.Camera` can handle lifecycle-related issues<br>
  Slowing down the new solution to `0.25x` makes it feel like: `waiting for a while before displaying the camera` (right image)
    <img src="/images/mlkit/001.gif" width="80%"><br><br>
  - However, the noticeable improvement is that it is easier to scan when using odd angles or when the camera is farther away

<div class="c-border-content-title-4">Adjusting the New Camera android.hardware.Camera in the App</div>
- Add target resolution setting when creating ImageAnalysis `.setTargetResolution(Size(screenResolutionForCamera.x, screenResolutionForCamera.y))`
- The screenResolutionForCamera is set using the screen resolution to set the camera target resolution<br>
  The difference between setting the camera target resolution or not is `higher success rate of scanning from a distance`<br>
- `Additionally`: the API Java doc mentions
  1. The default resolution of the camera without TargetResolution set is `640*480`
  2. After setting, there will be a priority to choose the actual `Resolution`
  3. Here is the outline: Priority is given to resolutions close to and greater than the Target Resolution > Priority is given to resolutions close to and smaller than the Target Resolution > The ratio of the resolution will be primarily determined by the provided `Size`
  4. Therefore, it is speculated that due to `hardware limitations`, the `distance` that can be resolved may vary for each device

<div class="c-border-content-title-4">Results</div>    
 - After the above adjustments and optimizations, when asking QA colleagues to help test<br>
 They reported that the accuracy of the app has indeed improved compared to the previous version<br>
 Upon further inquiry, they said the `success rate of scanning from the side` or `from a farther distance` or `being detected` has indeed increased
 Thus... a problem was solved XD

  - Thank you all for reading the above analysis<br>
  I have placed the source code at the top of this article<br>
  If interested, you can clone it directly and modify it<br>

  - Below I will share the main code analysis of the QR code scanner<br>
  Feel free to refer to it if interested
<div class="c-border-content-title-1">BaseCameraLifecycleObserver</div>    
<script src="https://gist.github.com/KuanChunChen/c99170df495f4c7352a9c81f54f63bb7.js"></script>
<div class = "table_container">
  <p>Code Explanation</p>
  The BaseCameraLifecycleObserver class is mainly used for inheritance by others<br>
  It contains some basic camera initialization content<br>
  It also handles some lifecycle-related content<br>
  (e.g., handling the camera according to the lifecycle)<br>
  It also provides external methods to manually turn the camera on or off<br><br>
  <p>cameraProviderDeferred</p>
  Worth mentioning is the use of cameraProviderDeferred here<br>
  It is used to obtain ProcessCameraProvider<br>
  Since this operation is time-consuming, asynchronous operation is used for more flexibility<br>
  (However, I have also tried directly instantiating ProcessCameraProvider<br>
  In most cases, it is not easy to encounter ANR or stuck situations<br>
  Only occasionally 1 or 2 times on older models, such as Android 5.0)<br><br>

  The concept here is<br>
  CompletableDeferred uses .apply<br>
  Within the apply scope, it creates ProcessCameraProvider<br>
  Use `await()` to wait where needed<br>
  Achieving asynchronous operations while waiting for the actual creation before proceeding<br><br>

  The difference between completableDeferred and regular Deferred is<br>
  It can be manually controlled to complete using complete()<br>
  Which is suitable for this example<br>
  Need to wait for the ProcessCameraProvider listener to return<br>
  To know that initialization is complete<br>

<div class="c-border-content-title-1">ScannerLifecycleObserver</div>    
<script src="https://gist.github.com/KuanChunChen/6bbc490b5ce7596a2218c9b2beadd6c9.js"></script>
<div class = "table_container">
  <p>Code Explanation</p>
  ScannerLifecycleObserver is relatively simple<br>
  Inherits from BaseCameraLifecycleObserver<br>
  Mainly writes features that might be needed based on project requirements<br>
  Such as some extended content<br>
  Like <b>getCameraDisplayOrientation</b><br>
  Can be used to adjust the supported resolution of the camera<br>
  Or getImageAnalysis to get ImageAnalysis<br>
  ImageAnalysis is mainly used in MLKit to set which barcode types can be parsed<br>

<div class="c-border-content-title-1">ScannerAnalyzer</div>    
<script src="https://gist.github.com/KuanChunChen/7c3d18a8025bb0959b1339f633120c99.js"></script>

<div class = "table_container">
   <p>Code Explanation</p>
  ScannerAnalyzer is used to implement barcode parsing<br>
  Inherits from BaseCameraLifecycleObserver<br>
  Since we are parsing QR codes, we use <b>FORMAT_QR_CODE</b>
