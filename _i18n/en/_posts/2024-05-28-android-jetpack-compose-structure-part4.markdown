<div class="c-border-content-title-4">Introduction</div>
* This is the fourth article in this series.<br>
At this stage, we will focus more on<br>
implementing the UI/UX design drafts.<br>
You can start writing and detailing the code.<br>

<div class="c-border-content-title-1">Project Setup</div>
* The libraries used are as follows:
<div id="category">
    {% include table/compose-use.html %}
    {% include table/compose-category.html %}
</div>

<div class="c-border-content-title-4">Sharing Experiences on Common Screens</div>
* After collaborating with different UI/UX designers,<br>
I found that many design screens have common components<br>
specific to the current project.<br><br>
If there are some components that are universally used<br>
throughout the project, you can extract them to create common Compose components.<br>
(It mainly depends on how you communicate with the designer.)<br><br>

* Common components like edittext, dialog, or some custom components<br>
can be made into reusable Compose components.<br>
Here are a few examples of such components.<br>
You can implement them based on your needs.<br>

<div class="c-border-content-title-1">Edittext</div>
<img src="/images/compose/002.png" width="100%"><br><br>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/waitzShigoto/1a5a6e77cbaa7565c95152467d9aa6eb.js"></script>

<div class="c-border-content-title-1">Dialog</div>
<img src="/images/compose/003.png" width="100%"><br><br>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/waitzShigoto/9eb6c6296cfab8ec4e17f5e151f3a205.js"></script>

<div class="c-border-content-title-1">Dialog</div>
<img src="/images/compose/004.png" width="100%"><br><br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/waitzShigoto/055ae82beba153468b22473973fc97e8.js"></script>

<div class="c-border-content-title-4">Assemble Your Screens</div>
* Next, you can start assembling various screens.<br>
If the new screens and designs follow the same pattern,<br>
you can easily assemble the screens<br>
you painstakingly created earlier.<br><br>
For example, the following screen uses the common toolbar<br>
from the initial setup article and the Compose components shared above.

<div class="c-border-content-title-4">Responding to Screen Updates with Flow</div>

<div class="c-border-content-title-1">Creating Flow</div>

* Modern apps have more and more features,<br>
so the sources or requirements for obtaining values have also increased.<br><br>
If a feature is required to handle multiple screen changes<br>
with different sources of values,<br>
I might use Flow to handle the values returned by various coroutines.<br><br>
Use Flow for the return or type of source data.<br>
Sometimes you can't control the access speed of the data source,<br>
such as network requests or querying large amounts of data from a local DB.<br>
So you can use Flow to wait for the data to be emitted to you.<br>
Here's a brief example:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/waitzShigoto/15bd34c56591b39a43887e892a0ff1bf.js"></script>

<div class="c-border-content-title-1">Create ViewState to Store Data Needed for Screen Response</div>
* Next, to organize all the content on your screen that will change<br>
you can create a data class to store the data needed for your screen<br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/waitzShigoto/df6639924388dce2a2def14fe45d39c0.js"></script>

<div class="c-border-content-title-1">Combine Flows Using `combine`</div>
* Next, use `combine` to combine various data sources<br>
`combine` will combine all your flows<br>
and combine the most recent values emitted<br><br>
The principle behind its implementation is to use function types or lambda functions<br>
to return a flow of the type you specify<br>
<img src="/images/compose/006.png" width="100%"><br><br>
* If you want to make judgments within the lambda `{}` you can consider doing so<br>
Finally, return the result you want using the ViewState defined earlier<br>
`.stateIn` can set the initial value of this R-type flow<br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/waitzShigoto/93f44fdfaae010f19254a3b0cc5cfc5a.js"></script>

<div class="c-border-content-title-1">Using Data Provided by Flow in Compose</div>
* After completing the previous steps, you can use `.collectAsState()` to get the flow<br>
and collect it into a state that Compose can use<br>
At this point, you can responsively update the screen~<br>
