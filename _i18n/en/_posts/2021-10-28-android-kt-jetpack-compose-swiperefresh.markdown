Today we will continue to fully implement the pull-to-refresh feature based on Jetpack Compose LazyColumn.<br>

<div class="c-border-content-title-4">Related Knowledge Used</div>
* JetpackCompose SwipeRefresh, LazyColumn
* ViewModel

Combining the concepts introduced earlier,<br>
and applying the SwipeRefresh component in Jetpack Compose,<br>
you can easily achieve the target functionality.<br>


Today we will learn how to use what we have learned before,<br>
and integrate SwipeRefresh into the application.<br>
This process is very intuitive,<br>
and with just a few simple steps,<br>
you can add pull-to-refresh functionality to your list.<br>

<div class="c-border-content-title-4">Meaning of Each Variable</div>

`state` is a boolean that observes whether a pull-to-refresh is happening.<br>

`onRefresh` allows you to input the scope of the task to be done.<br>

`indicator` allows you to set the details of the spinning symbol that appears during pull-to-refresh.<br>
The code for this is as follows:<br>
```
indicator = { state, trigger ->
            SwipeRefreshIndicator(
                state = state,
                refreshTriggerDistance = trigger,
                contentColor = Color.Black,
                arrowEnabled = true,
                fade = true,
                scale = true,
                backgroundColor = MaterialTheme.colors.primary,
            )
}
```
Other settings can be configured according to the names above,<br>
such as size, background color, arrow appearance, arrow color, refresh distance, etc.<br>

Another key point is<br>
we use an `isRefreshing` variable and put it into the `state` variable required by SwipeRefresh.<br>
The state of SwipeRefresh<br>
will determine whether to show the spinning animation based on your status.<br>
So when the status is `true`,<br>
the spinning waiting animation will be present.<br>
When it changes to `false`,<br>
here I use `LiveData` and observe it as state,<br>
and then observe the data retrieval after refreshing<br>
to set it to end.<br>

This pull-to-refresh<br>
is simply completed.<br>
You can also try it out quickly!<br>
