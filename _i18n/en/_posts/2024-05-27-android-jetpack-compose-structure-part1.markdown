<div class="c-border-content-title-4">Introduction</div>
* It's been 2~3 years since I last posted an article related to `Jetpack compose`<br><br>
During this period, I occasionally touched upon it<br>
But I never systematically studied it<br><br>
Recently, I had the opportunity to develop an entire project using Compose<br>
So after some exploration<br>
I have some insights to share<br><br>
I've decided to write this process down as notes to share with everyone<br>


<div class="c-border-content-title-1">Project Setup</div>

* First, I will decide which libraries to use this time<br>
This time, I chose to challenge myself with the latest official recommendations<br><br>

* Some of these libraries are also the latest versions applied when creating a new project in AS<br>
Such as `material3`, `kts+toml configuration`, `jetpack compose`, etc.<br>
Additionally, I previously shared issues encountered during `toml` migration<br>
If interested, you can <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/android-upgrade-to-toml-tutorial">check it out</a><br><br>

* The actual plan is as follows:
<div id="category">
    {% include table/compose-use.html %}
    {% include table/compose-category.html %}
</div>

<div class="c-border-content-title-4">Implementing Compose Themes</div>

* Previously, when using XML, I would add color codes to colors.xml<br>
Then place the color resource ID into styles.xml to achieve dark mode theme configuration<br><br>
Now with `compose`, you can configure the app's theme through `.kt`<br>
You can configure it according to the needs of each project<br>
Personally, I prefer to set `ColorScheme`, `shape`, `typography`, `statusBarColor`, `navigationBarColor`, etc., based on `UX/UX design drafts`<br>
Rather than designing each page individually<br>
This saves a lot of repetitive development time<br>


<div class="c-border-content-title-1">step1. Add compose-related libs and material3</div>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/waitzShigoto/416e5be6bcc5a0a6221d0fd027a503cb.js"></script>
Import as needed<br>
The actual usage of toml is written like this: `implementation(libs.androidx.material3)`<br>
Place it in your `build.gradle.kts(:app)`<br><br>
 * `tips`: The multiple libraries above support automatic mapping of corresponding library versions when importing androidx-compose-bom, so you don't necessarily need to input version.ref<br>
<div class="c-border-content-title-1">step2. Configure a common Theme including color, shape, typography</div>

Here is the documentation on Material 3 theme
<a class="link" href="https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/blob/master/docs/theming/Color.md" data-scroll>documentation</a>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/waitzShigoto/7daaa21db73354b5ea4c6f7a9adefc1e.js"></script>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/waitzShigoto/6315bd0157777d118f0def22f2f7e288.js"></script>

<div class="c-border-content-title-1">step3. Actual Use of Theme</div>
Here we set up the status bar, navigation bar, theme, etc.<br>
The colorscheme is applied from the previous implementation
<script src="https://gist.github.com/waitzShigoto/a94e4b1cde86b6b8789bdd1e89d526ca.js"></script>
Use in Activity or Screen:<br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/waitzShigoto/eef8ce349264ca797f6644676a588ffa.js"></script>

<div class="c-border-content-title-1">(Optional) step4. Create a Universal Toolbar</div>
* Here we create a universal toolbar<br>
Because usually when a UI/UX designer provides the design<br>
Most of the time the toolbar will have a similar effect<br>
I would write a universal toolbar based on the design draft<br>
You can decide whether you need to do this step<br>
As follows:<br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/waitzShigoto/448372236d5ae5dd508b69a3c5e350ac.js"></script>
Here is the actual use of `MainAppBarConfig`<br>
The main thing is to add the desired style or click response in `MainAppBarConfig`<br>
Then put it in the `topBar` of the `Scaffold`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/waitzShigoto/0d011cba78589066d77d921d2e029a5e.js"></script>
<div class="c-border-content-title-4">Conclusion</div>
* This is the end of the first part<br>
The main thing is to lay a solid foundation<br>
Future development will be very convenient and efficient!<br><br>
