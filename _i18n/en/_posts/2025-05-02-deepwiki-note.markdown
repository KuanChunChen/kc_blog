<div class="c-border-main-title-2">Deepwiki</div>
* This AI tool provides `Github repo scanning and analysis` and `document generation`, allowing users to understand third-party libraries on Github more quickly<br>
: https://deepwiki.com/<br>
 For example: GreenDao, lottie-android<br>
 It helps you understand third-party libraries faster<br>
 Or you can pass the documents directly to AI to understand and modify code<br>

<div class="c-border-main-title-2">Feature Overview</div>
- Automated Documentation Generation<br>
      - DeepWiki analyzes code, README files, and configuration files to automatically generate structured technical documentation covering project goals, core modules, dependency diagrams, and more. The generated documentation is more detailed than traditional READMEs and can provide clear explanations even for projects lacking documentation.
  - Interactive AI Assistant<br>
      - Users can ask questions in natural language, and can use "Deep Research" mode to detect potential vulnerabilities, optimization suggestions, or cross-repository comparative analyses.

<div class="c-border-main-title-2">How to Use</div>
  - If someone has already scanned a GitHub repository, you can search for it directly. If not, you can follow the steps below<br>

  - When connecting to GitHub, change the domain name from `github.com` to `deepwiki.com`, for example:
https://github.com/microsoft/vscode â†’ https://deepwiki.com/microsoft/vscode.
  - For repositories that haven't been analyzed yet, it will indicate that indexing and analysis are pending, and you'll need to wait for a while
    <br><img src="/images/cursor/057.png" alt="flutter"><br>
  - Next, you need to enter your email and click `indexing repository` to start the analysis<br>
    <br><img src="/images/cursor/058.png" alt="flutter"><br>
  - After the analysis is complete, you'll be able to search for the indexed content on the homepage<br>

<div class="c-border-main-title-2">Use Cases</div>
  - Helps newcomers quickly understand complex project structures, reducing learning costs; supports teams in improving collaboration efficiency through shared documentation.<br>
  - Addresses the pain point of missing documentation. Sometimes open-source content without official documentation can be difficult to understand.<br>
  For example: RS previously used the `lottie` third-party library to display animations. Here, we use AI to help check if there's room for optimization<br>

  When using third-party libraries with tight deadlines, you might not have much time to look at the source code. In such cases, you can follow AI suggestions to optimize your implementation, such as resource optimization:<br>

<div class="c-border-main-title-2">Challenges</div>
* Accuracy verification: AI-generated content may have errors, requiring human verification, especially for complex logic or edge cases.
