<p class="table_container">
  This article will share my development experience with you,<br>
  focusing on the challenges and solutions brought by Android version upgrades.<br>
  By analyzing the problems I encountered,<br>
  I hope to provide some valuable insights for you when facing similar issues during the development process.<br><br>
  If you want to see what the official changes are,<br>

<div class="c-border-main-title-2">Features Affected by Android 12</div>
<div class="c-border-content-title-4">
   New OS Camera and Microphone Permission Switches in Android 12 and Above
</div>
  - Users can enable/disable through the quick buttons in the start bar or the `Camera or Microphone Access` switch in settings.
  - This may affect the user experience with the camera,<br>
  even if the camera permission is enabled,<br>
  as long as the user disables camera access,<br>
  it will show a black screen for the camera.<br>
  The same applies to the microphone: [Reference](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/explaining-access#toggles)

  - Currently, the following code can be used to detect if the system supports it and provide a prompt to the user. There is no API to determine if it is enabled.
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/waitzShigoto/c7469603bb0f6b6b533447c7d7c9e0cf.js"></script>

  <div class="c-border-content-title-4">
     Deprecated ACTION_CLOSE_SYSTEM_DIALOGS in Android 12 and Above:  
     <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-all#close-system-dialogs" target="_blank">Reference</a>
  </div>
   - However, in Android 13, it was tested that when `Accessibility Permission` is enabled, ACTION_CLOSE_SYSTEM_DIALOGS can still be sent.
   If not enabled, the broadcast will not be received.

   <div class="c-border-content-title-4">
      New Default Splash Screen in Android 12 and Above
      <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/splash-screen/migrate" target="_blank">Migration guide</a>
   </div>

   - A new default icon splash screen is added as shown below:<br>
     ![android12_splash_icon.gif](/images/others/android12_splash_icon.gif)
   - After testing, there is currently no method to remove this default splash screen.<br>
     Only the method to remove the original custom Activity that does not display the screen but still runs the original cycle.<br>
     The official documentation also provides some specifications for the new splash screen: <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/splash-screen#elements" target="_blank">Reference</a><br>

   - Adjustment approach:<br>
     - Add `implementation 'androidx.core:core-splashscreen:1.0.0'` to build.gradle<br>
     Note that the minimum SDK requirement is 21 and above.<br>
     ![android12_splash_min_sdk.png](/images/others/android12_splash_min_sdk.png)
     - Set the new splash screen Theme
     <script src="https://gist.github.com/waitzShigoto/dd55d7b2cb70cedf158763083390d426.js"></script>
      `windowSplashScreenBackground` is the background color, which can only be set to @color.<br>
      `windowSplashScreenAnimatedIcon` is the icon for the circular view in the middle, which can be set to an image, but the size must follow the official specifications.<br>
      `windowSplashScreenBrandingImage` is the small background image below the icon.<br>
      `windowSplashScreenAnimationDuration` is the animation duration.<br>
      <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/splash-screen#set-theme" target="_blank">Other properties</a>
      <br>

     - Add the new SplashTheme to `AndroidManifest.xml`

     - Add initial code
     <script src="https://gist.github.com/waitzShigoto/7799d22f3d2839965678d9f75435bda5.js"></script>

     `SplashScreen.installSplashScreen(this)` must be called before `super.onCreate`<br>
     <br>
     `splashScreen.setKeepOnScreenCondition(() -> true );`<br>
     This line ensures that the old activity screen does not display, but the activity lifecycle will still run.<br>
     However, this approach uses the new official splash screen, so the original customized screen will not be displayed. Product owners can consider this as needed.

  <div class="c-border-content-title-4">
    On Android target SDK 12 and above, if the value of android:exported is not declared in the intent-filter, it may cause installation failure.
  </div>

  - As shown, when compiling and installing, the following error `INSTALL_PARSE_FAILED_MANIFEST_MALFORMED` is displayed:
   ![android12_exported_crash.png](/images/others/android12_exported_crash.png)<br>
  - Additionally, when using PendingIntent, corresponding flags must be added to avoid errors:
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/waitzShigoto/7ba7f042607cde3cb472af503088bce9.js"></script>
  - Solution & Demo:<br>
    - Add `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` or `FLAG_MUTABLE` tags at each PendingIntent creation.<br>
    - Also, add the latest work-runtime: `implementation 'androidx.work:work-runtime:2.7.1'`<br>
    ![android12_workmanager.png](/images/others/android12_workmanager.png)<br>
    - Notes<br>
      - For example, in the Airdroid project, since Airdroid & httphelper repo are separate, other places also need to be corrected.
      - Implicit PendingIntent also needs modification, as libraries used in the implementation may also use PendingIntent.
      For instance, the current `Airdroid` project uses Google Analytics version 17.0.0, but errors are still prompted.
      (You will only know if there is a PendingIntent error when running that specific code segment)
      ![android_12_error_01.png](/images/others/android_12_error_01.png)
      In this case, upgrading the version will suffice:
      `implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-analytics:18.0.1'`

  <div class="c-border-content-title-4">
    When upgrading the target SDK to 32, setAppCacheEnabled(flag Boolean) and setAppCachePath(path String) are removed.
  </div>

   Since Chromium has removed this feature, the SDK no longer supports it: <a href="https://web.dev/appcache-removal/" target="_blank">Reference</a>
  ![android12_appcache.png](/images/others/android12_appcache.png)

  <div class="c-border-content-title-4">
    When upgrading the target SDK to 32, enabling foreground services while running in the background is restricted:
      <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/components/foreground-services#background-start" target="_blank">Reference</a>
  </div><br>
  Currently, testing on SDK 32 shows that foreground services can still run in the background.<br>
  Initially tried running StartForegroundService in the background Service, and it worked fine. This will be monitored further.<br><br>

  The official recommendation is to use WorkManager as a replacement for execution:
  <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/foreground-services?hl=zh-cn#recommended-alternative" target="_blank">Reference</a>


  <div class="c-border-content-title-4">
    To encourage saving system resources
  </div>

 Alarm Manager API in Android 12 requires declaring the `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` permission to use


 <div class="c-border-content-title-4">
   Android 12 has imposed sampling rate limits on motion sensors
   <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_overview#sensors-rate-limiting" target="_blank">Reference (only available on the English official website, not in Chinese)</a>
 </div>

 When using registerListener() to register a sensor listener to monitor sensor events, the maximum sampling rate is limited to 200Hz<br>
 To use a higher Hz, you must add the `HIGH_SAMPLING_RATE_SENSORS` permission<br>

 <div class="c-border-content-title-4">
    Android 12 behavior changes for approximate/precise location
 </div>

 In this version, when requesting approximate/precise location permissions,<br>
 you need to request both `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` and `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` simultaneously,<br>
 to display the new location permission request dialog<br>
 If you encounter this, take note: <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/location/permissions#approximate-request" target="_blank">Reference</a>

 <div class="c-border-content-title-4">
    Android 12 has separated Bluetooth permissions
 </div>
  Previously, when using Bluetooth-related APIs, you needed to declare<br>
  `Manifest.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN` and `Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`<br>
  to search for nearby Bluetooth devices<br>

  If you encounter using startDiscovery.. and other APIs to search for nearby devices<br>
  Using the old permissions when targeting API 32, `API returns fail or some APIs directly crash`<br>
  ![android12_ble.png](/images/others/android12_ble_crash.png)<br>

  You can modify it like this:<br>
  1. Add `android:maxSdkVersion="30"` to the old permissions
  2. Declare new permissions `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`, `BLUETOOTH_SCAN`, or `BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE` as needed
  ![android12_ble.png](/images/others/android12_ble.png)
  3. Previously, runtime permission requests only required the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission, now they are separated, and you need to add the above `Bluetooth permission requests` at runtime<br>

    and <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth/permissions#declare-android12-or-higher" target="_blank">Bluetooth permission separation explanation</a><br>
