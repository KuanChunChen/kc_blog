<div class="c-border-main-title-2">Characteristics of Linked Lists</div>
A Linked List is a data structure composed of non-contiguous memory addresses, linking elements through pointers.

<div class="c-border-main-title-2">Advantages of Linked Lists</div>
Compared to Arrays, Linked Lists have the following advantages:<br><br>

1. Linked Lists are flexible in size and do not require a pre-specified size.<br>
2. The cost of inserting and deleting elements is lower, as it only requires changing the pointer direction without needing to shift the entire structure.<br>
3. They do not require contiguous memory space, making them more flexible.<br>

<div class="c-border-main-title-2">Disadvantages of Linked Lists</div>
Compared to Arrays, Linked Lists have the following disadvantages:<br>

1. Random access efficiency is lower, as traversal must start from the first node.<br>
2. Additional memory space is needed for pointers in each node.<br>
3. Relative addressing cannot be used directly. Arrays have contiguous addresses, allowing for relative addressing, but Linked Lists do not.<br>

<div class="c-border-main-title-2">Composition of Linked Lists</div>
Each node in a Linked List contains the following two elements:<br>

1. Data<br>
2. Pointer<br>
