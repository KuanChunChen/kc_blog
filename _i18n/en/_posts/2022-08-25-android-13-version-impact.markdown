This article will share my development experience with you,<br>
focusing on the challenges and solutions brought by Android version upgrades.<br>
By analyzing the problems I encountered,<br>
I hope to provide some valuable insights for you when facing similar issues during the development process.<br>

<div class="c-border-content-title-4">
   New Battery Usage Restrictions in Android 13 and Above: <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/13/changes/battery#restricted-background-battery-usage" target="_blank">Reference Document</a>
</div>
  - When targeting Android 13, the system will not send any of the following broadcasts unless the app is started for other reasons:
      - BOOT_COMPLETED
      - LOCKED_BOOT_COMPLETED

<div class="c-border-content-title-4">
   After Upgrading BUILD_SDK Version to 33, a New writeBytes(byte data[]) Method is Added in ByteArrayOutputStream
</div>

 - Previously, during development, someone had written a custom `writeBytes` method
   which coincidentally had the same name, causing compilation errors.
 - If considering upgrading the build SDK, the project owner can consider removing, renaming, or adding public to the method.

<div class="c-border-content-title-4">
   Device Admin Permission Behavior Adjustment
</div>
  - If Device Admin permission is granted, it will be permanently disabled if the app is not used.
  (Self-testing found that if Device Admin permission is turned off, it remains grayed out and cannot be modified)
<div class="c-border-content-title-4">
     Refined Access Permissions in Android 13
</div>
  - Only requesting old permissions will cause a crash, but it can be replaced with `All Files Access Permission`.
  ![android13_access_permission.png](/images/others/android13_access_permission.png)
  - AirDroid requests `All Files Access Permission`, so no modification is needed currently. Below is the Intent to navigate to that page: <br>
    `new Intent(Settings.ACTION_MANAGE_APP_ALL_FILES_ACCESS_PERMISSION);`
  - For modifications, refer to the demo:
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/waitzShigoto/d75998c921b176e659c911a938da4930.js"></script>

  <div class="c-border-content-title-4">
       Changes in Notification Permissions in Android 13
  </div>
  - Since Android 13 disables notifications by default: [Official Document on Notification Permission Changes](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notification-permission?hl=zh-tw)
  - Therefore, when executing NotificationManager,
    the system will prompt to enable notifications.

  - For behavior changes, refer to [Articles on Adaptation by Netizens](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/572147515)

  - To handle permissions yourself, you need to upgrade to target SDK 33
    to handle the Manifest.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission.

    Or, when targeting SDK 32, move the initialization of NotificationManager to a later point,
    but you won't be able to handle user rejection of Manifest.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS.

  - target SDK 33 demo patch: [Demo](http://192.168.201.72:8080/c/airsos/+/21558)
