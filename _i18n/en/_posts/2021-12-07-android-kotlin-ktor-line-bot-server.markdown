<div class="c-border-main-title-2">Introduction</div>

Due to my love for the Kotlin language, I spent some time researching the Ktor library,<br>
and in my spare time, I created a small side project.<br>
This project is a server written in Ktor, used to connect to a LINE chatbot.<br>

This article aims to set up a custom server using Kotlin Ktor,<br>
which can connect to a LINE chatbot to achieve automatic message replies.<br>

  This article introduces how to easily set up your own LINE chatbot<br>
  based on a Kotlin Ktor server.<br>
  Ktor is a simple and easy-to-use framework,<br>
  which can be used to build different applications.<br>
  Its scalability and high performance make it a good choice.<br><br>

  Through the introduction in this article,<br>
  you will learn how to build your server using Kotlin and Ktor,<br>
  and connect to a LINE chatbot.<br><br>

  We will set up the environment through Gradle and reference some necessary libraries.<br>

</div><br>

<div class="c-border-main-title-2">Implementation Method</div>
  First, create a Ktor project.<br>
  I used the Ktor plugin to create it directly.<br>
  Many configuration files are already set up for you.<br>
  You just need to understand what each one does.<br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="/images/linebot/ktor01.png" width="65%"/>
  </div><br>
  First,<br>
  create an application.conf file in the root directory,<br>
  mainly used to set Ktor-related parameters,<br>
  such as the port number and the package path of the main program's Application.module.<br>

  <script src="https://gist.github.com/waitzShigoto/ba0e0d520e9166fe6c45b16d2217fc48.js"></script>  <br>
  Next, create an application.kt file<br>
  ```Kotlin
  fun main(args: Array<String>): Unit = io.ktor.server.netty.EngineMain.main(args)

  ```
  This code mainly describes that Ktor uses Netty's engine,<br>
  so it needs to point to main(),<br>
  but Ktor also supports other frameworks,<br>
  which I haven't had time to research yet. I might try them in the future.<br>

  ```kotlin
  fun Application.module() {...}
  ```
  This is the server block that the .conf file points to for execution.<br>
  It is written using Kotlin's extension.<br>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/waitzShigoto/c88cf59e7c6e1e2599cfe52a107278df.js"></script>
Below is an example of implementation,<br>
where we add the relevant code to enable Ktor to support Gson for parsing JSON.<br>
The purpose is to allow the HTTP server to use Gson to parse data when receiving it.<br>
```Kotlin
install(ContentNegotiation) {
        gson {
            setPrettyPrinting()
        }
    }
```

You can define some API endpoints here,<br>
such as POST, GET, etc., to allow external users to interact with your server by calling the API.<br>
The example below defines an API endpoint named /callback.<br>

```Kotlin
routing {
      post("/callback") {...}
}
```

This section has covered the basic Ktor syntax,<br>
next, you can consider how to deploy your Ktor Server online.<br><br>

You can choose to use third-party server hosting services,<br>
or you can apply for a fixed IP + Domain Name to set up your own server.<br>
Alternatively, you can do what I did,<br>
I used ngrok, which provides a free 2-hour session,<br>
and generates a fixed Domain Name that you can provide to external users to connect.<br>
If you just want to try it out yourself or let friends play around, you can use this method.<br>

<div class="c-border-content-title-4">Brief Introduction to ngrok Usage</div>

Using ngrok is very simple,<br>
just download the ngrok CLI and add it to your environment variables,<br>
then start the server, and it will generate HTTP and HTTPS connection URLs.<br>
You can modify the port to connect with your Ktor server.<br><br>

Once installed, simply enter the following command in the terminal
(the port can be adjusted as needed)
```
ngrok http 8080
```

<div class="c-border-main-title-2">LINE Bot Signature Verification</div>

According to the Line Developer documentation,<br>
when you receive a request from Line's official server,<br>
you must ensure that the received header x-line-signature is verified with the request body and channel secret using HmacSHA256.<br>
Only when they match,<br>
can you confirm that it is Line's official server calling your server,<br>
to prevent malicious attacks on your server.<br>

Here is my Kotlin implementation for signature verification<br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/waitzShigoto/dab3f90689f9aa887d01c225caadd348.js"></script>

Next, we continue to learn the LINE Developer API,<br>
for example, if you want the LINE bot to automatically reply to messages in the chatroom,<br>
you need to use the following API.<br>
Below is a cURL command for reference,<br>
with cURL, developers can use their preferred language to develop.


```shell
curl -v -X POST https://api.line.me/v2/bot/message/reply \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {channel access token}' \
  -d '{
    "replyToken":"nHuyWiB7yP5Zw52FIkcQobQuGDXCTA",
    "messages":[
        {
            "type":"text",
            "text":"Hello, user"
        },
        {
            "type":"text",
            "text":"May I help you?"
        }
    ]
  }'
```

Additionally, if you want to connect to some of your own services or third-party packages,<br>
you can call the package first,<br>
and then reply to the line-bot-server.<br>
The same goes for web scraping,<br>
scrape the data and then call the official API.<br>

For example, I created some commands,<br>
when receiving the corresponding command,<br>
it will perform the related processing.<br>
```Kotlin
enum class TextCommandType(var type: String){
    MESSAGE_PICK_UP("/æŠ½ "),
    MESSAGE_HELP("/help "),
    MESSAGE_PICK_NAME("/pick " ),
    MESSAGE_PRICE_CRYPTO_TRADE_ID("/price " ),
    MESSAGE_NOT_CONTAIN("")
  }
```

<script src="https://gist.github.com/waitzShigoto/ccf9f4c1a07013ff89c0357ef37ecda0.js"></script>

Here is an example,<br>
mainly showing how one of the commands fetches data from a third-party API to get trading pairs.<br><br>

In fact, the implementation of each command is quite similar,<br>
just write the behavior you want to execute under the specified command,<br>
and then return the result.<br>
