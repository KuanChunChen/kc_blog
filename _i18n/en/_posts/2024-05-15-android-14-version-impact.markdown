<div class="c-border-content-title-4">Summary of some important changes in the Android 14 platform, all applications will behave differently on this platform</div>
<div class="c-border-content-title-1">Core Features</div><br>

* The system no longer grants precise alarm permissions by default, applications need to apply for them themselves.
   - Android 14 no longer grants the `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` permission by default for apps targeting SDK >= 33<br>
   (By default, it is set to `deny`)
   - This permission was introduced in Android 12 (previous <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2022/08/24/android-12-version-impact/">note</a>)

   At that time, it was only necessary to declare it in AndroidManifest.xml
   Now you need to `request permission`
   - `Request permission` steps:
     1. Use `AlarmManager.canScheduleExactAlarms()` to check for permission
     2. Call an intent containing `ACTION_REQUEST_SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` in `onResume()`
     3. Example:
     ```Kotlin
     override fun onResume() {
           …  
           if (alarmManager.canScheduleExactAlarms()) {
               // Set exact alarms.
               alarmManager.setExact(...)
           }
           else {
               // Permission not yet approved. Display user notice and revert to a fallback  
               // approach.
               alarmManager.setWindow(...)
           }
        }
     ```
   - The official recommendation is to remove the use of precise alarms if not necessary: [Click here](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/schedule-exact-alarms?authuser=7&hl=zh-cn#use-cases)


  * When the application enters the `cached state`, broadcasts registered by the context will be queued.
    - Broadcasts received at this time will enter the queue and will be returned to the app sequentially the next time the app returns to the `foreground` or leaves the `cached state`.
    - Cached state: Simply understood as an app in the background, not currently in the foreground process, so if the system needs memory elsewhere, it can freely terminate these processes as needed.
    - Only context-registered broadcasts will be queued, `static registrations will not`, such as those added in AndroidManifest.xml.

<div class="c-border-content-title-1">Application Management</div>

   * Apps can only terminate their own background processes and cannot affect other applications.
     - After targeting SDK 34, you can no longer use `killBackgroundProcesses` to close other app background processes
     - If your app uses this method to close other app background processes, it may no longer work in the future
   * The MTU setting for the first GATT client requesting MTU is set to `517` bytes and `ignores` all subsequent MTU requests for that ACL connection.
       - Simply put, after the GATT client in the app creates and connects (BluetoothGatt#connect),<br>
       the first time the API `BluetoothGatt#requestMtu(int)` is used to set the MTU, the system sets it to 517 bytes<br>
       - Related knowledge:
       `MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)`: The maximum amount of data that can be sent in a single packet<br>
       `Bluetooth Core Specification 5.2`: The official change is mainly to strictly comply with this specification. [Click to view the specification](https://www.bluetooth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Bluetooth_5.2_Feature_Overview.pdf)
       - If you plan to implement Gatt connection to `Bluetooth devices` and set MTU in the future, you can refer to: [This tutorial](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_38436214/article/details/132334688)
       - `If your product actually transmits data with Bluetooth devices`,<br>
       due to MTU limitations, you may encounter many situations that need adaptation.<br>
       For example: setting MTU in Gatt, but the target Bluetooth device does not support it, you may need a contingency plan<br>
       Or the Bluetooth device needs to adjust its firmware due to changes in Android 14, etc...<br>

<div class="c-border-content-title-1">User Experience</div>

* New permissions allow users to select which `photos` and `videos` can be accessed.
    - Android 14 introduces the `photo selection` permission `READ_MEDIA_VISUAL_USER_SELECTED`
    - Using `READ_MEDIA_VISUAL_USER_SELECTED` allows users to `select` which `photos` and `videos` can be accessed<br>
    or choose to `allow all` access. As shown in the image below, two options will appear for the user to choose from:<br>
    <img src="/images/android14/001.png" width="35%">

    - In `Android 13`, permissions were already refined once,<br>
    using `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO` and `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` to access `all` photos and videos at once: <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2022/08/25/android-13-version-impact/">Previous Android 13 notes</a>
      ```kotlin
         <!-- Devices running Android 12L (API level 32) or lower  -->
         <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"
         android:maxSdkVersion="32" />

         <!-- Devices running Android 13 (API level 33) or higher -->
         <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES" />
         <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_MEDIA_VIDEO" />

         <!-- To handle the reselection within the app on Android 14 (API level 34) -->
         <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_MEDIA_VISUAL_USER_SELECTED" />
      ```
    - The above methods can be adjusted according to needs, but
    if `READ_MEDIA_VISUAL_USER_SELECTED` is not used in Android 14, it will use [compatibility mode](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/partial-photo-video-access?authuser=7&hl=zh-cn#compatibility-mode)

    - Compatibility mode: Each time, it will prompt the user to select which photos and videos can be used by the app.
    - The official statement is that this is a way to enhance `user privacy`.

    - Practical example:
      ```kotlin
       if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.UPSIDE_DOWN_CAKE) {
           requestPermissions.launch(arrayOf(READ_MEDIA_IMAGES, READ_MEDIA_VIDEO, READ_MEDIA_VISUAL_USER_SELECTED))
       } else if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.TIRAMISU) {
           requestPermissions.launch(arrayOf(READ_MEDIA_IMAGES, READ_MEDIA_VIDEO))
       } else {
           requestPermissions.launch(arrayOf(READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE))
       }
      ```
      Or see the official permission example: [Click here](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/partial-photo-video-access?authuser=7&hl=zh-cn#permissions)
  * New behavior: `Non-dismissible` notifications can now be `dismissed` by users. [Official documentation](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/behavior-changes-all?hl=zh-tw&authuser=7#non-dismissable-notifications)
    - Android 14 has changed this behavior, allowing users to dismiss such notifications
    - In simple terms: Currently using `Notification.Builder#setOngoing(true)` and `NotificationCompat.Builder#setOngoing(true)`
    to set Notification.FLAG_ONGOING_EVENT to prevent users from dismissing foreground notifications `will no longer work`
    - The actual effect will be like this (left: Android 14, right: Android 11):<br>
      <img src="/images/android14/002.gif" width="35%">
    - However, the following two situations are still not prohibited:
      1. The phone is locked
      2. The user selects `Clear all` notifications
    - And the following types are currently not affected:
      1. CallStyle notifications: Simply put, `phone-like` notifications
      For example:
      ```Kotlin
         val builder = NotificationCompat.Builder(context, CHANNEL_ID)
             .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.notification_icon)
             .setContentTitle("Incoming call")
             .setContentText("Caller Name")
             .setPriority(NotificationCompat.PRIORITY_HIGH)
             .setCategory(NotificationCompat.CATEGORY_CALL)
             .setFullScreenIntent(fullScreenPendingIntent, true)
             .setOngoing(true)
             .addAction(R.drawable.ic_accept, "Accept", acceptPendingIntent)
             .addAction(R.drawable.ic_decline, "Decline", declinePendingIntent)
             .setStyle(new NotificationCompat.DecoratedCustomViewStyle())
      ```

      2. Becoming a Device Policy Controller (DPC) and supporting software packages

<div class="c-border-content-title-1">Accessibility Features</div>

* Non-linear font scaling up to 200%.
   - Refers to Android adjusting system support for `text font` scaling up to 200%<br>
     Before adaptation, font scaling might cause layout issues.
   - You can adapt using the following methods:
     1. a. Always use `sp` to set text font size
     2. b. You can also set it programmatically
     Using `TypedValue.applyDimension()`: sp to pixel
     `TypedValue.deriveDimension()`: pixel to sp
     3. c. (optional) Use sp units for `lineHeight`: If using dp or px units<br>
     In this case, text cannot scale or may look squeezed<br>
     Set both textSize and lineHeight using sp<br>
     The system will adjust line height and font size according to settings.
     (Mainly depends on whether your product needs to set line height)
     4. d. [Official documentation](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/features?authuser=7&hl=zh-cn#sp-units)
   - Testing method:
     Open `Settings` > `Accessibility` > `Display size and text`
     In the font size option, click the plus (+) icon to adjust to the maximum scale.
   - It has little impact on `compilation`, mainly requiring additional adaptation if needed,
   In older code, you might see font settings using dp, or some code `converting dp to pixel`,
   So if encountered, you can change it conveniently, or develop a habit of using the officially recommended solution.

<div class="c-border-content-title-1">Security</div>
* The minimum installation requirement for `targetSdkVersion` API level has been raised to `23`.
  - Mainly, after `Android 14`, only apps with targetSdkVersion `>= 23` can be installed.

  - However, if you just want to test during development, you can use the following adb command:<br>
  `adb install --bypass-low-target-sdk-block filename.apk`<br>

  - The main purpose of this is to `prevent malicious software` from using old versions to bypass new security constraints,<br>
  for example: using targetSDK 22 to bypass the permission request restrictions of `Android 6.0 Marshmallow (API 23)`. <br>

* The data safety information displayed on Google Play has been adjusted: it mainly displays based on the provided information,<br>
it will not have a compilation impact on the app, mainly the information displayed on the page after listing,<br>
you can refer to this URL to see if your app or product needs adjustments: [click here](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10787469?authuser=7&hl=zh-Hans#zippy=%2C%E5%A6%82%E6%9E%9C%E6%82%A8%E7%9A%84%E5%BA%94%E7%94%A8%E4%BC%9A%E5%88%86%E4%BA%AB%E7%94%A8%E6%88%B7%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E7%94%A8%E6%88%B7%E4%BC%9A%E7%9C%8B%E5%88%B0%E4%BB%80%E4%B9%88%E4%BF%A1%E6%81%AF)<br>
* System notifications: Now, if an app shares location with a third-party library, users will be notified which apps have shared location with third parties within 30 days.<br>
  <img src="/images/android14/003.png" width="60%">
* You can use the media storage query to list the OWNER_PACKAGE_NAME field of applications that store specific media files.<br>
Starting from Android 14, unless at least one of the following conditions is met, the system will mask this value:
  - The application storing the media file has a package name that is always browsable by other applications.
  - The application querying the media storage requests the QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES permission.


<div class="c-border-content-title-4">Behavior changes for apps targeting Android 14</div>

* For applications targeting Android 14 (API level 34) or higher,<br>
Android 14 will enforce the `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permission when calling the BluetoothAdapter#getProfileConnectionState() method.<br>
  - If used, add this permission in `AndroidManifest.xml`
  - Check if the permission has been granted before use

* If JobScheduler uses `setRequiredNetworkType` or `setRequiredNetwork`,<br>
  it now needs to declare the `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` permission,<br>
  otherwise, it will cause a SecurityException on Android 14 or higher.<br>

* Restrictions on `implicit` intents and pending intents: Android 14 adds restrictions on the use of implicit intents.
  - Implicit intents can now only be used on components that are already exported, you can set `exported = true`, or use `explicit intent`<br>
  e.g. Use `explicit intent` or `exported = true`

  ```xml
  <activity android:name=".MyActivity" android:exported="true">
     <intent-filter>
         <action android:name="com.example.action.APP_ACTION" />
         <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
     </intent-filter>
  </activity>
  ```


  ```kotlin
   // This makes the intent explicit.
   val explicitIntent =
           Intent("com.example.action.APP_ACTION")
   explicitIntent.apply {
       package = context.packageName
   }
   context.startActivity(explicitIntent)
  ```

  - When using `mutable` pending intents without specifying the package name, exceptions may be thrown.<br>
  Example of an exception using a pending intent with `FLAG_MUTABLE`:<br>
  ```
  Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);
  PendingIntent pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, intent, PendingIntent.FLAG_MUTABLE);
  ```
  Add the package name to avoid exceptions:<br>
  ```
   Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);
   intent.setPackage("com.example.myapp");
   PendingIntent pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, intent, PendingIntent.FLAG_MUTABLE);
  ```
* Now you need to add the flag `RECEIVER_EXPORTED` or `RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED` to the Broadcast receiver registered in the context,<br>
  to protect the application from security vulnerabilities.

```
 val receiverFlags = if (listenToBroadcastsFromOtherApps) {
      ContextCompat.RECEIVER_EXPORTED
   } else {
      ContextCompat.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED
   }
   ContextCompat.registerReceiver(context, br, filter, receiverFlags)
```

* Files currently using dynamic code loading must be set to `read only`<br>
Otherwise, an exception will occur<br>
This is due to the official consideration of its [security](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/security-tips?authuser=7&hl=zh-cn#DynamicCode)
  - Official recommendations for existing loading files can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/behavior-changes-14?authuser=7&hl=zh-cn#handle-existing-files)
  - If you must dynamically load code, use the following method<br>
  Set the dynamic file (such as DEX, JAR, or APK file) to read-only immediately before opening and writing any content to it:

  ```Kotlin
   val jar = File("DYNAMICALLY_LOADED_FILE.jar")
   val os = FileOutputStream(jar)
   os.use {
       // Set the file to read-only first to prevent race conditions
       jar.setReadOnly()
       // Then write the actual file content
   }
   val cl = PathClassLoader(jar, parentClassLoader)
   ```

* To prevent zip traversal vulnerabilities<br>
Now, when using ZipInputStream.getNextEntry(), paths containing `..` or `/` will throw a `ZipException`<br>
  - If you want to bypass this validation step, you can directly call `dalvik.system.ZipPathValidator.clearCallback().`<br><br>

* `USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT`: Used to display full-screen notifications on Android 11 and above<br>
  However, on Android 14, it can only be used on `call` and `alarm` type apps<br>
  After `2024/05/31`, Google Play will revoke apps that use this permission for other purposes.<br>
  - Currently, you can use the API `NotificationManager#canUseFullScreenIntent()` to check if full-screen notifications can be used.
  - If you do not have permission, you can request the `ACTION_MANAGE_APP_USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT` permission.<br><br>

* Now, when using a foregroundService, you must declare the `android:foregroundServiceType` attribute
  - This attribute was introduced in Android 10, and now in Android 14, it must be declared, otherwise, an error will occur.
  - The official documentation provides `13` types for developers to declare, refer to [documentation](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/fgs-types-required?hl=zh-tw&authuser=7)
  - The official recommendation is that `if it is unrelated to the above types`, you can migrate the logic to `WorkManager` or `user-initiated data transfer operations`.
  - If you declare using the above types, each type requires different permissions to be declared, for example: for the commonly used `mediaProjection` in our project, the following steps need to be completed:<br>
    a. Declare `android:foregroundServiceType mediaProjection` in AndroidManifest.xml<br>
    b. In addition to the original ForegroundService permission, declare the `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PROJECTION` permission<br>
    c. Before executing startForeground, use the `createScreenCaptureIntent()` method to confirm the permission with the user, then start the foreground service.<br>
    d. When calling startForeground, include `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_MEDIA_PROJECTION`<br>

    ```kotlin
     startForeground(
         AIRSOS_ID,
         notification,
         ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_MEDIA_PROJECTION)
    ```

  - Other types follow similar concepts, but the permissions to be declared or the ServiceInfo to be added will vary depending on the type, please refer to the aforementioned documentation.
  - Besides the above, currently using `AirDroid Remote Support` to adjust and see, there are several directions to fix this issue
    a. Use the `dataSync` type to bypass this issue.<br>
       `dataSync` does not require additional permissions at runtime, so the original process is less likely to be affected,<br>
       -> `Risk`: If all are declared as `dataSync`, it can be modified with less effort in the short term and is less likely to affect the process, but it will be unrelated to the official documentation types.<br>
       (The official documentation explains the responsibilities suitable for different types)<br>
       It was found that `dataSync` is already noted by the official to be `deprecated` in the future, as shown in the image<br>
       <img src="/images/android14/004.png" width="70%"><br>
    b. For those requiring additional permissions at runtime, obtain the permissions from the user before executing startForeground in the original process<br>
       For example: `mediaProjection` requires calling createScreenCaptureIntent() to obtain the mediaProjection permission before startForeground.<br>
       Here is a demonstration<br>
       Update your build sdk version<br>
       <script src="https://gist.github.com/waitzShigoto/7c4a8ef7b18660749a8acec308992d2b.js"></script>
       Add the following permissions<br>
       <script src="https://gist.github.com/waitzShigoto/1f396d04ca999787104f31dd735a4ae0.js"></script>
       Add the foreground service type according to your needs<br>
       <script src="https://gist.github.com/waitzShigoto/333cca6030d4e727740f89ca74e529de.js"></script>
```

       -> `Actual Issues Encountered`: In the `Service` code I wrote earlier,<br>
       I had already added `foregroundServiceType` (previously not mandatory),<br>
       and this `service` has methods that operate actions within the class,<br>
       such as startForegroundService.<br>
       Therefore, according to the official documentation, in Android 14 and above,<br>
       you need to call `createScreenCaptureIntent()` to obtain permission.<br>
       Although adding the above sample can prevent crashes,<br>
       the expected flow will differ from the `original plan`,<br>
       requiring additional time to split logic, test, and modify the overall code, etc.<br>
       Since each time you need to obtain the above permission for the foreground service,<br>
       it means that products or solutions that previously used foreground services will need adjustments.<br>

       - Note: 【Runtime】, here refers to the execution of `startForeground`.<br>
       In practice, if you `do not follow the documentation` to obtain the corresponding permission `before execution`, it will cause an `exception` and `crash`.<br>
       - Example of a crash is as follows:<br>
       <img src="/images/android14/005.png" width="60%"><br>
   c. Later, cross-tested several scenarios:<br>
       - Declaring multiple foregroundServiceTypes in the `Manifest` using `|`.<br>
       <img src="/images/android14/006.png" width="60%"><br>
       And in the source code, providing `different types` of `foregroundServiceType` based on `different version checks`.<br>
       <img src="/images/android14/007.png" width="60%">

       - Tried not adding `foregroundServiceType` in the source code,<br>
       which would `crash` and show no `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE` permission<br>
       (in the case of declaring `multiple types`).<br>
       <img class="zoomable" onclick="zoomImage(this)" src="/images/android14/008.png" width="60%">

         So, I went to test other Services,<br>
         simply adding `dataSync` in the Manifest,<br>
         even if no `foregroundServiceType` is entered in the source code, it will not `crash`.<br>
         But mixing `microphone` with an empty `foregroundServiceType` will `crash`.<br>
         (Left will `crash`, right runs normally, click to enlarge)<br>
           <div style="display: flex;">
               <img src="/images/android14/009.png" width= "45%" style="margin-right: 10px;">
               <img src="/images/android14/010.png" width= "45%" >
           </div>
